 * All the challenges are imported and tested below. Uncommented the ones you do

 * Then, uncomment line 22 to see the test results for the challenge in the
 * console.
 *
 * The boolean in line 21 (true) is there to turn error suppression on
 * for some of the default logging we have.
 *
 * You can add additional logs in the test file as needed when updating the tests.

 * Run `npm test` in terminal to get started. Have fun. ┻━┻ ︵ ლ(⌒-⌒ლ)
