##Instructions for QA:##

**We are currently trying to review these challenges to prepare them for addition to the Free Code Camp curriculum expansion. We need your help!**

A first draft of the entire **React, Redux, React-Redux** curriculum has been completed and is ready for review from campers.

[View the challenges here and begin working through them](http://hysterical-amusement.surge.sh/)

We need campers to provide the following feedback on the challenges:

- The content explains the topic well
- There are no grammatical errors in the content
- The tests are clear and function properly
- Each individual challenge functions correctly without any bugs (:sweat_smile:)

In addition, we tried to create a nice flow to the overall narrative of the challenges. If you work through several in sequence, try to reflect on how well the challenges perform consequetively.

##To Submit Your Feedback:##

**The easiest way to submit feedback on a challenge is to open an Issue here on the repository. Title it with the name of the challenge if an Issue has not already been opened for that challenge.**

Then provide your feedback in the Issue and we'll open a discussion to deal with it.

**There is also an [Issue specifically for providing general feedback](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module/issues/17)**

Alternatively, you can fork and edit the repository directly and submit a Pull Request if you are comfortable doing that. However, it will be best to at least open a discussion about the changes unless you find something that unambiguously needs to be changed.
