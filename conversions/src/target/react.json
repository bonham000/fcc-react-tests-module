It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.",
        "For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: <code>{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }</code>. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.",
        "However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test in these challenges fail.",

The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, on the other hand, can be written as <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.

For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set <code>propTypes</code> on your component to require the data to be of type <code>array</code>. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.",
        "It's considered a best practice to set <code>propTypes</code> when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a <code>propTypes</code> property for a component in the same way you defined <code>defaultProps</code>. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type <code>function</code> for a prop called <code>handleClick</code>:",

Also notice that <code>func</code> represents <code>function</code>. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, <code>function</code> and <code>boolean</code> (written as <code>bool</code>) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the documentation for all of the options.",

If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.",

You call the <code>setState</code> method within your component class like so: <code>this.setState()</code>, passing in an object with key-value pairs.

        "You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the <code>state</code> important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that <code>state</code>, which are passed in as props.",
        "For example, maybe you have an <code>App</code> component that renders a <code>Navbar</code>, among other components. In your <code>App</code>, you have <code>state</code> that contains a lot of user information, but the <code>Navbar</code> only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of <code>state</code> to the <code>Navbar</code> component as a prop.",
        "This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is <em>unidirectional data flow</em>. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.",

For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new <code>props</code>, even if the <code>props</code> haven't changed. You can use <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> to prevent this by comparing the <code>props</code>. The method must return a <code>boolean</code> value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (<code>this.props</code>) to the next props (<code>nextProps</code>) to determine if you need to update or not, and return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> accordingly.",

Another option is to apply <strong><em>inline</em></strong> styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.",

      "description": [
        "Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the <em><strong>ternary operator</strong></em>. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for <code>if/else</code> statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional <code>if/else</code> statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, <code>if/else</code> statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago &mdash; when an <code>if/else</code> statement was required, it was always <em>outside</em> the <code>return</code> statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:",

First, initialize the state of <code>CheckUserAge</code> with <code>input</code> and <code>userAge</code> both set to values of an empty string.",
        "Once the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's <code>return</code> statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, <code>buttonOne</code>, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than <code>18</code>, render <code>buttonThree</code>. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to <code>18</code>, render <code>buttonTwo</code>."

        "So far, you've seen how to use <code>if/else</code>, <code>&&,</code> <code>null</code> and the ternary operator (<code>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse</code>) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers &mdash; that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.",
        "In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.",

        "First, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use <code>Math.random()</code>. This method returns a value between <code>0</code> (inclusive) and <code>1</code> (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use <code>Math.random() > .5</code> in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return <code>true</code> 50% of the time, and <code>false</code> the other 50%. On line 30, replace the comment with this expression to complete the variable declaration.",
        "Now you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the <code>Results</code> component as a child of <code>GameOfChance</code>, and pass in <code>expression</code> as a prop called <code>fiftyFifty</code>. In the <code>Results</code> component, write a ternary expression to render the text <code>\"You win!\"</code> or <code>\"You lose!\"</code> based on the <code>fiftyFifty</code> prop that's being passed in from <code>GameOfChance</code>. Finally, make sure the <code>handleClick()</code> method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row."

You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.",
        "This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.",

        "Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using <code>Array.map()</code> in React illustrates this concept.",
        "For example, you create a simple \"To Do List\" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to <em><strong>dynamically render</strong></em> the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day. ",

You'll notice a <code>textarea</code> and a <code>button</code>, along with a couple of methods that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.",
        "Inside the <code>constructor</code>, create a <code>this.state</code> object and define two states: <code>userInput</code> should be initialized as an empty string, and <code>toDoList</code> should be initialized as an empty array. Next, delete the comment in the <code>render()</code> method next to the <code>items</code> variable. In its place, map over the <code>toDoList</code> array stored in the component's internal state and dynamically render a <code>li</code> for each item. Try entering the string <code>eat, code, sleep, repeat</code> into the <code>textarea</code>, then click the button and see what happens.",
        "<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You may know that all sibling child elements created by a mapping operation like this do need to be supplied with a unique <code>key</code> attribute. Don't worry, this is the topic of the next challenge."

However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a <code>key</code> attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way. Note that keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.",

This time, make sure to give each <code>li</code> a <code>key</code> attribute, set to a unique value.",

However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a <code>renderToString()</code> method you can use for this purpose.",
        "There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.",
